## Archive

### Information

An archive of the different clients I worked on in the past. The majority of these clients were either not meant to be released at all or were meant to be released to a very small group of people, so parts of them were pasted; one was even created with the brilliant idea to be the most pasted of them all.

There were other developers involved in making some of these, but seeing how old these clients are, I seriously doubt any of them would be mad at disclosing the source codes.

Still, if some developer is not pleased with these sources being open, Either a developer of one of the clients themselves or someone whose code was skidded in the development of these, please reach out to me on my [Discord](https://discord.com/users/1275070050386313379) and I'll try to resolve any issues you might have.
